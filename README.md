# Modular Desktop shell for Windows
![Modular Desktop banner](/misc/banner.png)

## What is Modular Desktop?
Modular Desktop is a fast, modular and powerful shell for Windows. The goal of Modular Desktop is to place customization in the nads of the user by providing a toolbar-based desktop that emphasizes modularity and tinkering. With both the common and power-hungry user in mind, this shell will provide an experience to beat the rest. This shell is not designed to replace the file management aspect of the Windows Explorer.

## What does it run on?
Modular Desktop is designed for all versions of Windows since 2000. Testing will be performed primarily on 8.1 and Vista, though, so bugs on other versions may crop up more often.

## Where do I get it?
The [releases page](/releases) will contain the latest version of Modular Desktop available for download, once builds are made available.

## How can I help?
Submitting [issues](/issues) and reporting or commenting on bugs that you find is a massive help. The next level is to contribute and create a [pull request](/pulls).
